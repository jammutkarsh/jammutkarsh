# Why do I have a GitHub Profile

![This only attracts attention, doesn't add any real value.](https://github.com/JammUtkarsh/jammutkarsh/blob/main/github-banner.png?raw=true)

I mostly build stuff to solve **my own problems**. Sorry world, you're on your own (unless you're planning to *hire me*, then *I'm suddenly a global visionary*).

Everything’s public because **I genuinely believe knowledge/code should be free and open**, not locked behind a paywall or someone's ego.

I love Docker — **most projects have a Dockerfile** so you can run them yourself.
Host it, Break it, Raise an issue, I'll fix it for you! Just don’t send me your AWS bill.

If you find something cool here and want to collaborate, hit me up! Maybe **we can build something together** that helps more than just... *me*.
